# My-Portfolio-Website

I'm excited to officially launch my new personal portfolio website! 🎉

This has been a fantastic project where I built a complete, responsive site from the ground up using modern web technologies. My goal was to create a professional space to showcase my projects and skills in data and business analysis as I look for internship opportunities.

Key Features: 
🔹 Built with HTML5, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS./n 
🔹 Fully responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes./n
🔹 Interactive elements like a typing effect, project filtering, and animations on scroll./n
🔹 A fully functional contact form using Formspree.

I'm proud of how it turned out and would love for you to check it out. Any feedback is welcome!
